# Misc. Sensors

There are other various sensors that are less commonly used but can still be encountered. We will list some here, as well as links to where you can find out how to program them.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using sensors made by other companies, you may need to install vendor libraries to handle them.

Many of the more basic types of sensors can be found [here.](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/software/sensors/ultrasonics-software.html)

One other sensor is the REV Robotics color sensor (which we have used in the past). The sensor can detect the color of what it looks at and can also serve as a distance sensor.
