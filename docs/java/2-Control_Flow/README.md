# Control Flow

## Goals

* Learn what the conditional operators are
* Learn what `if`, `else`, and `else if` statements are
* Learn what logical operators are
* Learn what a `switch` statement is
* Learn about `for` loops
* Learn about `while` loops

## Tasks

* Create a program where the user can input a number grade, and then the program will print the letter grade corresponding with it
* Create a program where the user can input a number, and then the program print out all numbers leading up to that number.
  * For instance, if the variable is 5, print "1 2 3 4 5"
