# Functions

## Goals

* Learn how to create a function to reduce repeated code
* Learn how to create a function with parameters
* Learn how to effectively make code cleaner with functions

## Tasks

* Create a function that returns the sum of the two parameters
* Create a function that swaps two elements of an array
  * The function should take in an array and the indices to swap
* Remake your calculator program using functions
  * Create a function that takes in the two numbers and the operation, and return the result
  * Replace your existing code with calls to that function
* Try to go back and remake other past programs using functions
