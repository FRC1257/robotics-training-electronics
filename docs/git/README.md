# Git

This section covers the various areas of Git in the commandline; use the sidebar to access the documents. Go through each one to get a better understanding of Git and how we use it.

> [!NOTE]
> With software like GitHub desktop and VSCode, you don't need to learn how to use the command line, but it's definitely a valuable skill.
